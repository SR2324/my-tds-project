TDS Project
Virtual Teaching Assistant (TA) designed for the "Tools in Data Science" course at IIT Madras's Online Degree program. Its primary goal is to automatically answer student questions by leveraging course content and past discussions from the TDS Discourse forum.

What's Inside
Data Scrapers: Code to extract information from TDS course materials (Jan 2025) and Discourse posts (Jan 1, 2025 - Apr 14, 2025).
API Endpoint: A POST endpoint that accepts student questions (with optional image attachments) and returns a generated answer along with relevant links to source materials.
